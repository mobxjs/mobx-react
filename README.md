Package with react component wrapper for combining React with mobx.
Exports the `observer` decorator and some development utilities.
For documentation, see the [mobx](https://mobxjs.github.io/mobx) project.
This package supports both React and React-Native.

## Installation

`npm install mobx-react --save`

```javascript
import {observer} from 'mobx-react';
// - or -
import {observer} from 'mobx-react/native';
// - or, for custom renderers without DOM: -
import {observer} from 'mobx-react/custom';
```

This package provides the bindings for MobX and React.
See the [official documentation](http://mobxjs.github.io/mobx/intro/overview.html) for how to get started.

## API documentation

### observer(componentClass)

Function (and decorator) that converts a React component definition, React component class or stand-alone render function into a reactive component.
See the [mobx](https://mobxjs.github.io/mobx/refguide/observer-component.html) documentation for more details.

```javascript
import {observer} from "mobx-react";

// ---- ES5 syntax ----

const TodoView = observer(React.createClass({
    displayName: "TodoView",
    render() {
        return <div>{this.props.todo.title}</div>
    }
}));

// ---- ES6 syntax ----

@observer class TodoView extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <div>{this.props.todo.title}</div>
    }
}

// ---- or just use a stateless component function: ----

const TodoView = observer(({todo}) => <div>{todo.title}</div>)
```

It is possible to set a custom `shouldComponentUpdate`, but in general this should be avoid as MobX will by default provide a highly optimized `shouldComponentUpdate` implementation, based on `PureRenderMixin`.
If a custom `shouldComponentUpdate` is provided, it is consulted when the props changes (because the parent passes new props) or the state changes (as a result of calling `setState`), but if an observable used by the rendering is changed, the component will be re-rendered and `shouldComponent` is not consulted.

### `componentWillReact` (lifecycle hook)

React components usually render on a fresh stack, so that makes it often hard to figure out what _caused_ a component to re-render.
When using `mobx-react` you can define a new life cycle hook, `componentWillReact` (pun intended) that will be triggered when a component will be scheduled to re-render because
data it observes has changed. This makes it easy to trace renders back to the action that caused the rendering.

```javascript
import {observer} from "mobx-react";

@observer class TodoView extends React.Component {
    componentWillReact() {
        console.log("I will re-render, since the todo has changed!");
    }

    render() {
        return <div>{this.props.todo.title}</div>
    }
}
```

* `componentWillReact` doesn't take arguments
* `componentWillReact` won't fire before the initial render (use `componentWillMount` instead)
* `componentWillReact` won't fire when receiving new props or after `setState` calls (use `componentWillUpdate` instead)

### `propTypes`

MobX-react provides the following additional `propTypes` which can be used to validate against MobX structures:

* `observableArray`
* `observableArrayOf(React.PropTypes.number)`
* `observableMap`
* `observableObject`
* `arrayOrObservableArray`
* `arrayOrObservableArrayOf(React.PropTypes.number)`
* `objectOrObservableObject`


### `Provider` and `inject` (Experimental)

_This feature is marked as experimental as the exact api might change in a next minor, pending any community feedback_.

`Provider` is a component that can pass stores (or other stuff) using React's context mechanism to child components.
This is useful if you have things that you don't want to pass through multiple layers of components explicitly.

`inject` can be used to pick up those stores. It is a higher order component that takes a list of strings and makes those stores available to the wrapped component.

Example (based on the official [context docs](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/context.html#passing-info-automatically-through-a-tree)):

```javascript
@inject("color") @observer
class Button extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <button style={{background: this.props.color}}>
        {this.props.children}
      </button>
    );
  }
}

class Message extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {this.props.text} <Button>Delete</Button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

class MessageList extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const children = this.props.messages.map((message) =>
      <Message text={message.text} />
    );
    return <Provider color="red">
        <div>
            {children}
        </div>
    </Provider>;
  }
}
```

Notes:
* If a component asks for a store and receives a store via a property with the same name, the property takes precedence. Use this to your advantage when testing!
* Values provided through `Provider` should be final, to avoid issues like mentioned in [React #2517](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/2517) and [React #3973](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/3973), where optimizations might stop the propagation of new context. Instead, make sure that if you put things in `context` that might change over time, that they are `@observable` or provide some other means to listen to changes, like callbacks.
* When using both `@inject` and `@observer`, make sure to apply them in the correct order: `observer` should be the inner decorator, `inject` the outer. There might be additional decorators in between.
* The original component wrapped by `inject` is available as the `wrappedComponent` property of created the higher order component.

#### Inject as function

The above example in ES5 would start like:

```javascript
var Button = inject("color")(observer(React.createClass({
    /* ... etc ... */
})))
```

A functional stateless componentn would look like:

```javascript
var Button = inject("color")(observer(({ color }) => {
    /* ... etc ... */ 
}))
```

#### Strongly typing inject

`inject` also accepts a function (`(allStores, nextProps, nextContext) => nextProps`) that can be used to pick all the desired stores from the available stores like this:

```typescript
import {IUserStore} from "myStore"

@inject((allStores) => ({
    userStore: allStores.userStore as IUserStore
}))
class MyComponent extends React.Component<{ userStore?: IUserStore; otherProp: number }, {}> {
    /* etc */
}
```

Make sure to mark `userStore` as optional property. It should not (necessarily) be passed in by parent components after all!

## FAQ

**Should I use `observer` for each component?**

You should use `observer` on every component that displays observable data.
Even the small ones. `observer` allows components to render independently from their parent and in general this means that
the more you use `observer`, the better the performance become.
The overhead of `observer` itself is neglectable.
See also [Do child components need `@observer`?](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx/issues/101)


**I see React warnings about `forceUpdate` / `setState` from React**

The following warning will appear if you trigger a re-rendering between instantiating and rendering a component:

```
Warning: forceUpdate(...): Cannot update during an existing state transition (such as within `render`). Render methods should be a pure function of props and state.`
```
-- or --
```
Warning: setState(...): Cannot update during an existing state transition (such as within `render` or another component's constructor). Render methods should be a pure function of props and state; constructor side-effects are an anti-pattern, but can be moved to `componentWillMount`.
```

Usually this means that (another) component is trying to modify observables used by this components in their `constructor` or `getInitialState` methods.
This violates the React Lifecycle, `componentWillMount` should be used instead if state needs to be modified before mounting.

## Internal DevTools Api

### trackComponents()

Enables the tracking from components. Each rendered reactive component will be added to the `componentByNodeRegistery` and its renderings will be reported through the `renderReporter` event emitter.

### renderReporter

Event emitter that reports render timings and component destructions. Only available after invoking `trackComponents()`.
New listeners can be added through `renderReporter.on(function(data) { /* */ })`.

Data will have one of the following formats:

```javascript
{
    event: 'render',
    renderTime: /* time spend in the .render function of a component, in ms. */,
    totalTime: /* time between starting a .render and flushing the changes to the DOM, in ms. */,
    component: /* component instance */,
    node: /* DOM node */
}
```

```javascript
{
    event: 'destroy',
    component: /* component instance */,
    node: /* DOM Node */
}
```

### componentByNodeRegistery

WeakMap. Its `get` function returns the associated reactive component of the given node. The node needs to be precisely the root node of the component.
This map is only available after invoking `trackComponents`.
